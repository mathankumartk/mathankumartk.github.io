Project 7: The Affordability Crisis: Major Factors Influencing Child Care Costs Across the United States
This comprehensive data analysis project investigates the critical factors affecting child care affordability across the United States, addressing a pressing challenge that impacts family stability, workforce participation, and economic growth. With child care costs often exceeding 10% of household income, this study aims to identify and analyze key economic, demographic, and policy-related variables that drive these expenses. Utilizing the National Database of Childcare Prices, which originally comprised 227 features refined to 70 relevant variables, the research examines median earnings, female labor force participation, household composition including single-mother families, dual-income households, poverty rates, and geographic variations across states and counties. The study introduces an Affordability Score metric (calculated as Median Child Care Cost / Median Household Income) to quantify financial burden and enable comparative analysis across different demographics and regions. Ethical considerations are integrated throughout, ensuring data integrity, avoiding bias in interpretation, and using publicly available data from the Department of Labor without personally identifiable information.
The methodology employs a multi-faceted analytical approach combining statistical analysis, correlation studies, and trend examination across temporal, economic, and social dimensions to understand child care cost dynamics. The findings are communicated through three distinct mediums tailored to specific audiences: Tableau dashboards for policymakers, government officials, and child care organizations featuring interactive visualizations of affordability trends, geographic disparities, and demographic variations; PowerPoint presentations targeting policymakers and parents/guardians focusing on economic indicators like median income, employment rates, and workforce participation; and web blog content for the general public exploring social factors including racial disparities, poverty impacts, and cultural dynamics. Key results reveal that while median household earnings increased gradually over the study period, child care costs rose significantly faster, resulting in declining affordability scores, particularly in high-cost states like California, Massachusetts, and New York. The analysis uncovered substantial racial and ethnic disparities, with minority groups generally facing higher living costs relative to economic capacity, and demonstrated that higher poverty rates correlate with lower child care prices, though this reflects limited resources rather than improved accessibility. Geographic analysis revealed that states like Kansas and South Dakota offer the most affordable child care, while coastal states experience severe affordability challenges, and the relationship between unemployment rates and affordability proved complex, with both high and low unemployment states exhibiting varying affordability levels. The research emphasizes that child care affordability significantly influences women's labor force participation, with states facing higher costs showing potential barriers to full economic engagement, and calls for targeted policy interventions including enhanced subsidies, equitable funding models, flexible work policies, and community-based support systems to create a more equitable child care landscape.
