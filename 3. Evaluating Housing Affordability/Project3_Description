Project 3: Evaluating Housing Affordability – Insights from Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning
The objective of this project is to analyze and predict rental prices based on various factors such as area, number of bedrooms, and availability of amenities like power backup. By identifying the key variables that influence rent, we aim to provide valuable insights for both landlords and potential tenants in the housing market. The project employs various statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, utilizing regression analysis to quantify the impact of these variables on rental prices. Additionally, descriptive statistics and visualization techniques such as histograms and scatter plots are used to better understand the relationships between variables. Ethical considerations were considered, ensuring the data used was anonymized and that predictive modeling does not perpetuate bias in rental decisions. The ultimately derived model seeks to support equitable housing practices.
The methods used in this analysis include data cleaning and preprocessing to identify and handle outliers, followed by the application of regression models, both single and multiple explanatory variable analyses. Results indicated significant correlations between rental prices and the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and available amenities. Moreover, comparative plots illustrate how variables interact with each other, revealing interesting patterns, such as the higher rental costs for homes with power backup compared to those without. The summary of our findings underscores the critical role of various factors in determining rental prices, emphasizing the importance of informed decision-making in the housing market. Overall, this analysis serves as a useful tool for both renters and landlords to understand market dynamics better.
