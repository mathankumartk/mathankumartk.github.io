Project 5: Assessing Loan Default Risks: A Machine Learning Framework for Loan Default Prediction
The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive predictive model that identifies the likelihood of loan defaults based on various borrower characteristics. By analyzing historical loan data, the project seeks to uncover key factors that influence borrower behavior, including credit history, income levels, and demographic details. Utilizing machine learning techniques such as Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest classifiers, the project aims to deliver accurate risk assessments for new loan applicants. This project aspires to enhance decision-making processes within financial institutions to minimize risks while promoting responsible lending.
The methods employed in the analysis include exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify significant trends and prepare the data for modeling. Following data preparation, various machine learning algorithms were tested, with the Random Forest model emerging as the most accurate classifier regarding predicting loan defaults. The model achieved a high level of accuracy and reliability, validating its effectiveness for deployment in real-world scenarios. Results indicated that the Random Forest model could accurately predict loan defaults, demonstrating robustness while minimizing potential overfitting issues. In summary, this project not only provides valuable insights into borrower behavior but also equips lenders with the necessary tools to make informed, ethical lending decisions, thereby contributing to greater financial stability in the lending landscape. Continuous monitoring and retraining of the model are advised to keep pace with changing data trends and borrower behaviors.
