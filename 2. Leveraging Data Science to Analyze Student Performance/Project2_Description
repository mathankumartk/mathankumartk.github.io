Project 2: Leveraging Data Science to Analyze Student Performance, Stress, and Academic Success

This research initiative aims to explore and understand the key factors influencing student performance, stress levels, and academic success using a data science approach. Recognizing the critical role students play in shaping society, the study focuses on identifying and mitigating stress factors that impact their physical and mental well-being, ultimately enhancing their academic outcomes. By analyzing three distinct datasets including Student Performance, Student Stress Factors, and Student Academic Success the research investigates correlations between various predictors such as alcohol consumption, sleep quality, family background, and socioeconomic factors with target variables like grades, stress levels, and academic success. The study employs data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization techniques, and statistical modeling to extract meaningful insights and provide evidence-based recommendations for educators, parents, and policymakers.

The research incorporates ethical considerations, ensuring data privacy and integrity while analyzing the datasets. The findings reveal that factors such as low alcohol consumption, high sleep quality, and strong academic performance positively influence student outcomes.  Additionally, external factors like noise levels and socioeconomic conditions significantly impact stress and academic success.  Logistic regression models were used to quantify the relationships between predictors and outcomes, highlighting key contributors such as semester grades, gender, and family dynamics. The study concludes that addressing stress-inducing factors and promoting positive influences can significantly improve student performance and success.  However, the research acknowledges limitations, including the need for larger, more diverse datasets and the importance of studying the same group of students across all three dimensions for more comprehensive insights.
