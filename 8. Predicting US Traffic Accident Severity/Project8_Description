Project 8: Predicting US Traffic Accident Severity: A Machine Learning Classification Framework Using Ensemble Methods and Class Balancing Techniques
This project aims to addresses the critical challenge faced by auto insurance companies, public safety agencies, and transportation departments in transitioning from reactive accident response to proactive prevention and resource optimization. With approximately 39,345 lives lost in US traffic accidents in 2024 and economic losses exceeding $340 billion annually, the need for accurate severity prediction is paramount. The research leverages a comprehensive dataset of 7.7 million accident reports across 49 US states, encompassing temporal, environmental, locational, and infrastructural features. The primary objective is to develop robust machine learning models capable of predicting accident severity levels 1 through 4 before incidents occur, enabling emergency services to optimize resource allocation and response strategies. This predictive capability supports data-driven policy interventions and enhances overall road safety outcomes. The project employs systematic data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and rigorous model evaluation to establish a foundation for operational deployment.
The methodology encompasses comprehensive data preprocessing including handling class imbalance, missing value imputation, categorical encoding, and feature engineering to create temporal variables such as hour, weekday, and weekend indicators. Multiple supervised classification algorithms were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, with hyperparameter tuning conducted using both Grid Search and Random Search techniques. After applying class balancing techniques such as SMOTE and stratified sampling, the Random Forest model emerged as the superior performer, achieving an impressive 93.51% accuracy with balanced precision, recall, and F1-scores across all severity levels. Ethical considerations were carefully integrated throughout the project, including data privacy protection through location aggregation, bias mitigation through fairness assessments across geographic and demographic proxies, and misuse prevention by emphasizing probabilistic interpretation requiring human oversight.
