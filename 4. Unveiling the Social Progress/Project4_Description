The primary objective of this project is to analyze the relationships between crime rates, corruption perceptions, and social progress indices across various countries. By assessing crime data, corruption perceptions, and social progress indices, we aim to identify socio-economic patterns and insights that may influence policy-making and development strategies. The methods employed include data extraction from flat files and web sources, followed by rigorous data cleaning, integration, and exploratory data analysis. We utilized Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations. Throughout the project, ethical considerations were upheld by using publicly available datasets, thereby adhering to privacy norms. 
The results of the study revealed intriguing correlations between the analyzed indices, such as the finding that countries with higher social progress scores often experience lower crime rates and corruption perceptions. Through statistical analyses and visual representations, we identified notable deviations and trends that could inform more effective governance and economic development initiatives. The significant findings from the data highlighted the potential impacts of socio-economic policies on crime reduction and the importance of transparency in governance. Overall, this project not only showcases advanced data handling techniques but also stresses the need for continued exploration of the socio-economic factors influencing global stability. The analysis underscores the interconnectedness of crime, corruption, and social wellbeing, education and transparency play pivotal roles in fostering a more just and equitable society. In summary, our findings advocate for data-driven policy decisions to enhance global crime governance and promote social progress while upholding ethical considerations.
